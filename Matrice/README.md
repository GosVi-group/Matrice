# Matrice
A libary for numerical computation, includes basic linear algebra (vector, matrix, linear system) operations, auto-differential, and non-linear optimization, etc. The library contains two parts, the first part is a Fortran kernel library which supplies the basic linear arithmatic operations; the second part is a modern C++ library which aims to implement efficient and elegant numeric computation.
